- Implementation: https://github.com/LLaVA-VL/LLaVA-Plus-Codebase

**Analysis:**
LLaVA-Plus introduces the first comprehensive framework for integrating and dynamically using external tools in multimodal AI systems. Its key innovation lies in maintaining a flexible skill repository of pre-trained models that can be activated based on contextual needs, enabling complex multi-step reasoning and task execution. This represents a significant step toward general-purpose multimodal assistants that can effectively combine visual understanding with external capabilities.

**Technical Details:**
The system demonstrates:
- Dynamic tool selection based on visual context
- End-to-end training methodology for tool integration
- State-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks
- Complete reproducibility with public code and datasets
